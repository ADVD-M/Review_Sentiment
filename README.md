# Review_Sentiment
Welcome to my first ever project. <br>
This project aims to sort Amazon reviews into positive and negative and also analyse them. <br>
It's a simple project in a Jupyter notebook, using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and nltk.

The dataset is the 'Amazon Fine Food Reviews' dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)<br>
Please download the dataset locally before running.<br>
